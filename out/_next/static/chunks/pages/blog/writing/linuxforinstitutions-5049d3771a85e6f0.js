This is the perfect example for why migration is difficult, and only has marginal, but measurable benefits. The project was named LiMux.

The three main barriers that the government of Munich faced with the migration were convertibility, staff, and time. Many documents and processes had to be transferred to different formats before the transition could happen.

There is a good argument for using proprietary systems like Windows since you are saving pennies per hour by using Linux, while paying a team of people to manage it.
